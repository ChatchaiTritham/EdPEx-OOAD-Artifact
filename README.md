# EdPEx information platform — design and evaluation artifact

Reproducibility artifact for two articles about one EdPEx (Baldrige-based) quality information
platform, built in two rounds at a Thai public university:

- *Object-oriented design and evolution of an EdPEx quality information system across two institutional
  deployments* (PeerJ Computer Science, submitted);
- *From excellence criteria to an operational quality system: designing an EdPEx information
  platform for a Thai university* (The TQM Journal, submitted) — Table III.

## What is here

| Path | Content |
|---|---|
| `snapshot/round1/`, `snapshot/round2/` | Rubric configuration as found in each code base (`edpex.json`, `cat7_evidence_map.json`, and in round 2 `pmqa.json`), database schema as DDL only, and the object-oriented source (`src/`) of each round |
| `data/derived_counts.json` | Counts taken from files that cannot be published (automated tests, application code, version history), each test file with its SHA-256 |
| `src/repo_metrics.py` | Recomputes every count reported in the articles |
| `results/metrics.json` | The counts as reported |
| `src/make_figures.py`, `figures/`, `results/figure_data.json` | Figures 3 and 4 of the PeerJ CS article and the data behind them |
| `verify.py` | Recomputes both result files and compares them with the committed versions |
| `tools/extract_snapshot.py` | How the snapshot was produced from the private repositories (authors only) |
| `MANIFEST.sha256` | SHA-256 of every file in `snapshot/`, `data/` and `src/` |

## What is not here, and why

The production repositories are not public. They contain credentials and migration files that seed
records about real students and staff, which Thailand's Personal Data Protection Act protects. The
snapshot therefore keeps only DDL statements (`CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP` for tables, indexes and
views); every `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` was removed, and the snapshot was scanned for e-mail
addresses, telephone numbers and identity-document patterns (0 matches). Automated tests and
application code are summarised in `data/derived_counts.json` rather than published, and the test
suites are not runnable here because they need the live database.

## Reproduce

Requirements: Python 3.9 or later; `pip install -r requirements.txt` (NumPy and Matplotlib, used only for the figures).

```bash
python verify.py
```

Expected output: `All 2 result files reproduced exactly from snapshot/ and data/.`
